# imdr
## Get imd data in R using postcodes

This package returns indices of deprivation data from OpenDataCommunities, when supplied with a dataframe containing a list of postcodes.

To install to R, first ensure you have the devtools package installed, then type into your R console:

  devtools::install_github("northernjamie/imdr")

You can then use the command imd_lookup(name of dataframe,column with postcodes) to create a new dataframe with indices of deprivation infert

Feedback very welcome, @northernjamie on twitter!
